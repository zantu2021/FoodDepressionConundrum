My dad argued, that cooking destroys all the lectins and other chemicals that are detrimental to us. For some reason back in the day it didn't come to my mind, why we don't cook amanita muscaria. Or why ppl with peanut allergies still react to the protein even when it's cooked.

* Amylase inhibitors 
  * starches and other complex carbohydrates aren't broken down, 
  * simple sugars aren't being broken down and absorption is prevented
    * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807301/ - metabolic problems and low serum amylase

* Avidin (raw eggs) - inhibits the absorbtion of biotin (vitamin b7) 
  * biotin deficiency: depression and anxiety

* Glucosinolates - Binds to iodine
  * iodine deficiency: anxiety and depression, Fatigue and low energy levels, Unexplained weight gain, Slow heart rate, Intolerance to cold temperatures, Fatigued and aching muscles, Dry and or coarse skin, Puffy face, Hair loss, Constipation, Problems with concentration

* flavonoids, (polyphenolic compounds), tannins - bind to iron and zinc
 * Iron deficiency: depression and anxiety
 * Zinc deficiency: depression and anxiety

* lectins - nuts and seeds
 * gluten, glutinin - inhibit the absorbtion of vitamin B12

* oxalic acid - binds to calcium 
  * can cause kidney stones, from memory: depending on where the crystals end up they might cause tissue damage, seemingly it's connected to fibromyalgia somehow

* phytic acid - binds to minerals - calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc
 * Calcium deficiency: depression, anxiety, and delirium
 * Magnesium deficiency: apathy and lack of emotion
 * Iron deficiency: depression and anxiety
 * Copper deficiency: learning impairments, poor memory and emotional and behavioral problems

* Protease inhibitors
 * alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency - connected to depression, anxiety
 * pepsin deficiency - connected to nutrient deficiencies in B12 and iron 
 * human pancreatic lipase suppression - connected to low omega 3 fatty acids - Deficiency may also pose a risk for schizophrenia, characterized by cognitive decline, delusions, and social isolation

* Thiocyanate - Binds to Iodine, converts to cyanide - Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Cabbage, Canola, Cauliflower, Flax, Kale
 * iodine deficiency: anxiety and depression, Fatigue and low energy levels, Unexplained weight gain, Slow heart rate, Intolerance to cold temperatures, Fatigued and aching muscles, Dry and or coarse skin, Puffy face, Hair loss, Constipation, Problems with concentration, goiter

# overconsumption of certain nutrients
 * Calcium can inhibit iron absorbtion
