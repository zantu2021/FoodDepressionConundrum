# The head
It's entirely possible, that the childhood trauma caused the body to find vegetables and bread threatening. I remember having fights over food with my mother and grandmother on several occaions as well as not being allowed to get up and play while everyone was eating. 

I've been playing around with self-hypnosis around trauma, but haven't found any effect appart from sleeping different. 

Recommendations would be Trauma + bodymapping

And almost all of michael sealey's hypnosis, he's been doing something weird with the background noise that others don't

# watch it!
What worked for me, to actually watch how I feel, I wrote down the first thought that I was aware of. 
It would go like this: Everything is too much, I want to be dead
That's a sign of high stress and I'd get rid of all unnessesary appointments for that day

occasionally I'd journal something like: ate clementine - and 4 days later I'd wanna kill myself. That particular entry was from 2016, I hadn't made the connection yet. 

On days where I'd eat a lot of fruit, I might have stressed more, because I was getting them from the place where all the poor ppl go to get old food from the supermarket.
On those days I'd be stressed and bored a lot. Maybe there was a connection back then. 
Or maybe the food just wasn't good food.
